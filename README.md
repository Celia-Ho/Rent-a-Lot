# Rent-a-Lot

Inspired by the high demand for parking spaces and any sort of real estate spaces in the GTA, this app is meant to create a way for the public to find and rent out available spaces for parking.

This app allows parking-lot owners to list their vacant parking lots for lease in Toronto like an Airbnb online.  Renters can search the app for the available parking lots from the listing and submit a form to rent the lot.  

The Google Map API will be used to show the location of each parking lot on a map.

All users will need to create an account and sign in to post a listing or rent a lot.
